## Hello, hello 👋

I'm Fernanda, and I like understanding why things behave the way they do, even when that knowledge isn’t strictly useful. 

Especially then. 

That's usually where the fun starts 😁


## What I’m interested in

Most of my curiosity lives around:

- JavaScript oddities and edge cases
- Web development beyond the surface
- Systems that look simple, but really aren’t
- Learning for the sake of learning!
  
I enjoy digging under the hood and following that thread until it turns into notes or code (and most of the time, both).


## What you’ll find here

This GitHub is less about polished products and more about thinking in public.
Here you’ll find small experiments and study repositories, as well as explorations meant to understand concepts, not just ship features.
Some repos exist purely because I was curious. 

And that’s intentional 🤓

## Writing things down

I write to organize what I’m learning and untangle thoughts that refuse to stay quiet.
You can find my longer-form writing on my blog: [My Uncompiled Thoughts](https://my-uncompiled-thoughts.hashnode.dev/).
This is where I try to make sense of what I’m learning. 

And if it also helps someone else make sense of a tangled idea, that’s already a win.

## Beyond code
When I’m not coding or writing, I’m probably:

- Spending time with my husband and our dog ❤️
- Reorganizing my Obsidian vault (again)
- Playing some single-player game (of course, I'm an introvert)
- Or just chilling, watching a random video while drinking a coffee ☕
